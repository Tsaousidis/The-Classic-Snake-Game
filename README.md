# 🐍 The Classic Snake Game 🐍

A fun and addictive Snake game built using Python's turtle module. Guide the snake, eat the food, grow longer, and avoid crashing into the walls or your own tail. How long can you survive?

## 📜 Description

This game is a classic implementation of the Snake game, where the objective is to control the snake, eat food to grow, and avoid hitting the walls or your own body. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the score increases. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.

### Key Features:
- **Smooth Gameplay**: Fast-paced action with continuous snake movement.
- **Food Generation**: Random food spawning on the screen.
- **Boundaries**: Clear and visible boundaries to avoid.
- **Score Tracking**: Track your progress and challenge yourself for a high score.
